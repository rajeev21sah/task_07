                <p class="about-dis">First Creation of Champarn District : 1866 On 2nd November 1972 Champaran district
                    was split up Into
                    two districts, viz. Purbi Champaran and Paschim Champaran. East Champaran is a part of Tirhut
                    Division. The headquarter of Purbi Champaran district is at Motihari .Presently Purbi Champaran
                    consists of Six Subdivisions and Twenty Seven Blocks. Nepal makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi
                    and Sheohar eastern while Muzaffarpur South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side.
                    The name Champaran owes its origin to Champa-aranya or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means
                    Magnolia and aranya mess forest. Hence, Champaranya means Forest of Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. It is
                    popularly believed that the nomenclature here was made while the vest forest part was inhabited by
                    solitary ascetics. It is needless to say that has Purbi means Eastern Side.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>From epic time till today, the history of Champaran has been glorious and important. It is mentioned in
                the Purana that the devotee Dhruv, son of King Uttanapada, here had done terrible penance for attaining
                knowledge at the place called Tapovan. On the one hand, the land of Champaran is sacred due to the
                Goddess of Sita, on the other hand, the Satyagraha of Gandhiji in modern India is an invaluable page in
                the history of Indian independence. At the time of King Janak, this was part of the Tirahut kingdom.
                People believe that Jankigharh, also known as Chanchigarh, was the capital of King Janakâ€™s Veeveda
                state. Which later became part of the Vaishali empire in the 6th century BC. Lord Buddha had given his
                sermons here, in memory of which in the 3rd century BC, Priyadarshi Ashok made pillars and constructed
                stupas. After the decline of the Gupta Dynasty and the Pala Dynasty, the entire Champaran region,
                including Mithila, became subject to the Karnat dynasty. Local satraps were directly ruled by Muslims
                until and after this. Mahatma Gandhi came to Motihari in April 1917 on the call of Prince Shukla, a
                rayat of freedom and freedom fighter of India during the freedom struggle, and successfully used the
                first successful experiment of Satyagraha in protest of the three acrimonious cultivation of the Nil
                crop. This was the beginning of the new phase in the fight for independence. Later, Bapu came here many
                times. The British had made Champaran an independent unit in 1866, but in 1971 it was divided into
                Eastern and Western Champaran. <a href="https://eastchamparan.nic.in/">Know more Motihari</a>
